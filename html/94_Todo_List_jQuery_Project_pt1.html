<!--
    Discription of the projcet:
        we will make a jQuery Base todo App, but it will have a pretty
        heavy focus on css and html, some animation.the first thing about
        this application is that it is responsive so we can resize it.
        as i hover overthings a delete button will pop up and we can delete
        that option with trashcan icon, and when we click on the delete button,
         it the text fades out and disapears. or when i click on the text we 
         can check it off, or line it through. then we can add another todo
         list in the in the list by writing in the add new todo placeholder and
         we will automatically get a new todo at the buttom that we can checkoff
         of delete. one more thing is that the plus icon at top  we can click
         it and hide the add new todo list and  by clicking on it again we
          can bring the add new todo list again.
          behind the seens we will use .on(), .keypress(), fades and slides
          , selecting, margin,  float and fonts.

    there are four new jQuery method we will introduce here:
            .parent()
            .append()// creating elements.
             and event delegation
           
    there are two new css method we will introduce here:  
            font-awesome
            box-shadow
            transition
            gradients// used for the background.

<!--

   1_first we will do doc then press then enter to add the boiler plate
   of html, then we will add the script of the js file in the html file.
   after that we will add the the script of jQuery and boostrap from
   getbootstrap.com, but bare in mind that if we want to add animations
   which are fadein and fade out then we will have to use .min for jQuery
   and not slim.min, because slim.min will not work for for jQuery effects.
   after that.

   2_we have a big heading, then we have button next to it,then we have
   an input, then we have an ul with some lis with spans in it. the 
   span will help us to add a clickListener to it and when we click on 
   it then it will delete the doto list.

   3_ what we want to happen is when we click on the todo list then
      its color wil change to gray and a line will be through it. next
      we want to turn back to black get rid of the line through when
      we click back on the li. 

      4_next we will tackle the span with the x button inside the li, when
      we click on the x, it should remove the entire todo, it should 
      fadeout and delete.there is  one problem with this span and that is
      when we click on the span which is the x, when we click on it,
      since it is a part of the li element, it will automatically will do 
      the instructions that we gave it to do which are the color changing to
      grey and  the line-through  when we click on it. this we will fix it
      in the js code. stopPropagation() is a jQuery method that will stop
      the event from bubbling up. so it will fire up until the span then
      it will not fire on the li element.

      5_This video is about creation of new todos.
      it is an input, when we write something init,and hit enter,
      then it will add whatever  we wrote in it in the todo list which
      we can checkoff or delete.first thing is we want to add a listener
      for the input which will fire when we hit the enter key.however,after
      adding the code to create a new todo list, the delete and checkoff will
      not work for the new ones which we created. and that is when we use
      click() and on(). we need to use on because this .on() will listeners
      to all the potential future elements. and to make it work, we need to
      change our js code slightly.

      6_next we want to work on the plus and trash icon. one thing to 
      keep in mind  is that if we want the trash can to show as well we
      add another new item, then we will have to change the code in our
      javascript code as well. when the trash can are added we need to work
      on the animation, and for that we will be done using css,  how we 
      do it is first we will set  the trash can's width to 0 and when we 
      hover over the li then its width will be 20px. then it is 
      enimated using the transmition property.

      7. the last thing that we want to do is to make the plus icon to
      toggle, which means make it to tadein and fade out.

      8_ the last thing we wanna do is to orgnize things to make it 
      to look better and more professional. the more popular way to
      do that we will arrange things in css for accodring to specificity.
