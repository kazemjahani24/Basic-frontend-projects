<!-- this lesson consist of a lof of html,css, js dom manipulation.
how this works is that we load up the page and we get 6 random colors
and one of the colors is listed above the six colors and we need to know
 the color and click on the correct one.for rgb there are three parts 
 and the first one is red, green,blue.and we can make all the rest of 
 the colors using these three colors.

    <!--4_now we want to make sure that every time we refresh the 
    page we get the randomized rgb code in the webpage written, so
    same as  the scoreKeeper excercise, we need to add a span to h1 
    so that only desired part of the code changes accordingly, and not the
    the rest of h1. by adding the span now we can easily select and
    manipulate the text.
